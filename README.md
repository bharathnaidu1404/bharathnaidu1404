🔎 A simple AI Search Agent built using n8n to fetch and return results automatically.

# 🔎 AI Search Agent — n8n + Google Gemini + SERP API + Memory

This is a simple but powerful **AI Search Agent** built using [n8n](https://n8n.io).  
The agent uses **Google Gemini** for reasoning, **SERP API** for live web search, and a **Memory module** to maintain context between queries — allowing it to behave more like a smart assistant.

## 🧠 Features

- 🌐 Real-time Google search using [SERP API](https://serpapi.com/)
- 🧠 Context retention using n8n's memory node
- 🤖 Response generation and summarization with **Google Gemini**
- 🪄 Modular n8n workflow — easy to extend or integrate
- ⚡ Can be triggered via webhook or manual input

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **n8n** — workflow orchestration
- **Google Gemini API** — AI model for reasoning and responses
- **SERP API** — fetches search results
- **Memory Node** — retains conversation context
- (Optional) Webhook Trigger

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Query** → User sends a search query (manual or webhook).
2. **Search Layer** → SERP API fetches relevant web results.
3. **Reasoning Layer** → Gemini model summarizes and answers based on results.
4. **Memory Layer** → Saves context to enable follow-up questions.
5. **Output** → Returns a smart, contextual response.
